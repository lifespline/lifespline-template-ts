# About

TS template.

# Motivation

Standard starting template for typescript projects.

# Getting Started

Clone this repo, read and run [init.sh](init.sh) to bootstrap your cloned repo. You are now ready to develop your TS project on this clone as a basis. There are [npm scripts](package.json) automating the flows:

- lint `$ npm run lint`
- test `$ npm run test`

Check [layout.md](/doc/layout.md) to understand the project layout. Check [`lifespline-demo-typescript`][demo] for a demo on how to use this template.

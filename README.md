# About

`lifespline-ts-template` is the `lifespline` TS template to bootstrap your typescript projects.

# Motivation

`lifespline-ts-template` comes from the need of having a standard starting template for typescript projects, instead of having to write one from scratch each time a project is initialized.

# Getting Started

Read the [init](/doc/init.md) guide to get started with your TS project.

# Architecture
